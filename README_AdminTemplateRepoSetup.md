# Creating your Repo from the Template

Once you have finished these instructions, your new repo is your app that your team owns. This was just the start. Your team members can clone the new repo and follow the [README](README.md) at the root for everyday development instructions. CircleCI will handle Continuous Deployment to Heroku with every commit to the `main` branch. In your new repo, you may add code and make any edits to code, documentation or configs as you see fit.

If you see a need for improvements in this setup process or in the template app out-of-the-box that other Stride adopters might benefit from, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stride-nyc/templ-node/issues)  with suggestions.

### Requirements

* <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Admin access to the GitHub Organization that will own your code (i.e. your team or your client org)

### Steps

From [this template's homepage on Github](https://github.com/stride-nyc/templ-node/), click the green button for "Use this template".

1. Choose your organization which will own this app
1. Choose your repository's name
1. Add optional description
1. Select Private

Once you have successfully created your new repo, you will see your new app's Github page with one `Initial commit` on one branch `main`.

From your new repo's README, please proceed to:
1. [First Time Deployment Instructions](README_AdminDeploymentSetup.md)
1. [Setup CircleCI](README_AdminCISetup.md)
